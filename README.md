# HFO-detect-python
Python library for automated HFO detection

This library is intended for anyone who is interested in high-frequency oscillations research, both medical doctors and engineers. The main purpose of this library is to bring together all developed methods for automated HFO detection and evaluate them on the same set of signals with the same evaluation methods. The secondary puropse is to allow anyone who just started using HFOs to use advanced detection methods developed by others.

The library is distributed under BSD 3.0 licence.

Additional information for users and developers can be found at github wiki.
